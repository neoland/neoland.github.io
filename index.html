    <!-- Intro -->
    
    <h1><b>Welcome to our list of useful learning resources!</b></h1>
    <br>
    <h5>This site was made by me, legion, and my friend, nzzhia. We both enjoy self-learning (autodidacticism!) and <br>
       we both have spent a lot of time online looking for good learning resources.</h5> 
    <br>
  
    
    
    <h2>Websites</h2> <br>
    
    <h4><u>Our favorite general education websites:</u></h4> <br>
    
    <!-- Khanacademy -->
    
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khanacademy</a> <br>
    <p>Personally, I have used Khanacademy for almost four years now.<br>
       I have used it to learn things ranging from polynomials to cell <br>
       structure to animation. A unique aspect of Khanacademy is that <br>
       the website is not categorized into courses, but is more of a drop-in <br>
       whenever you want to learn sort of thing. Information on Khanacademy <br>
       is easily accessible and the rewards system is enjoyable. Khanacademy <br>
       offers a vast variety of topics that are not shoved into specific <br>
       courses but offered comprehensively. Khanacademy's math resources cover <br>
       everything; from grade school to calculus to recreational math. There <br>
       also are great science resources, with chemistry, physics, biology, etc. <br>
       Khanacademy has also more recently made AP courses for many subjects. <br>
       SAT and other standarized test practice are available, as well as many <br>
      niche topics and fun, interesting videos.</p>

    <h4><u>Our favorite language learning websites:</u></h4>
    
    <!-- Duolingo -->
    
    <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> <br>
    <p>I am a long time user of Duolingo. As the golden standard of language <br>
       learning, Duolingo now offers courses in Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese, <br>
       English, and 28 other languages. Duolingo even offers High Valyrian and <br>
       Klingon! Time for the GOT fans to roll in. Duolingo can be found on mobile <br>
       as well as on a browser. Duolingo is focused on practice and naturally introduces <br>
       you to the grammar and vocabulary of a language. Like all language learning <br>
       sites, after completing a language, you may not be able to speak fluently right <br>
       after, but Duolingo gets you ready to become a fluent speaker after you finish <br>
       their language course. The entire system is cumulative and is built on practice and <br>
       review. <br>
       <br>
       Duolingo stands out from the crowd as a truly fast and easy way to learn a language. <br>
       It's addictive and fun to use, with features such as Leaderboards (which gives you <br>
       a good dose of competition) and Stories (which are stories in the language you are <br>
       learning that you can follow along with). It is streamlined and elegant and by far <br>
       the most popular way to learn a language online.<br>
